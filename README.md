# Prune Neural Network

## Pruning Neural Networks - README

This project involves the process of pruning a neural network to reduce its size while maintaining performance. Follow these steps to successfully prune your neural network:

1. **Define and Initialize Your Neural Network Model**: Create your neural network model using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. This model will be the basis for the subsequent pruning process.

2. **Record the Weights of the Model Before Pruning**: Before starting the pruning process, record the weights of your model. These initial weights serve as a baseline for comparison.

3. **Perform the Pruning Process on the Model**: Use the pruning technique of your choice to set some of the model's weights to zero. Pruning helps reduce the model's size.

4. **Fine-Tune the Pruned Model if Needed**: After pruning, fine-tuning may be necessary to recover some of the lost performance. Fine-tuning involves optimizing the remaining weights for your specific task.

5. **Record the Weights of the Model After Pruning**: Once you've pruned and potentially fine-tuned the model, record the weights again. These are the weights after the pruning process.

6. **Calculate the Weight Changes**: Calculate the differences between the weights before pruning and the weights after pruning. This will show you how the weights have changed during the pruning process.

7. **Analyze the Weight Changes**: Analyze the weight changes to understand the impact of pruning on the model's weights. Positive values indicate weights that have been pruned (set to zero), while negative values might indicate adjustments during fine-tuning.

By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively prune and optimize your neural network for more efficient deployment while retaining or improving its performance.
