# Prune Neural Network

##Steps

Define and initialize your neural network model.

Record the weights of the model before pruning.

Perform the pruning process on the model, setting some weights to zero.

Fine-tune the pruned model if needed.

Record the weights of the model after pruning.

Calculate the weight changes by subtracting weights before pruning from weights after pruning.

Analyze the weight changes to understand the impact of pruning on the model's weights.
